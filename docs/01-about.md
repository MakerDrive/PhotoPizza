## A Message from the Author

**I had to leave my country. Currently, I don't have access to the equipment needed for developing and testing the project, but I plan to restore the project description and publish all the materials developed before my departure soon.**

**I am looking for like-minded individuals worldwide who want to earn money from the open-source project, sell ready-made equipment, and participate in its development. I will post your contact information on the website, provide additional information, and packaging blueprints. Clients who don't have time to assemble the equipment themselves will reach out to you. I will not take any percentage of your profit. You will be the official representatives of this project in your country.**

**For inquiries, please contact photopizza@rnd-pro.com.**

## ðŸ”„ 360Â° Product Photography Turntable

**PhotoPizza** is an open-source project for creating a turntable that allows you to take pictures of objects from all directions (3D-photo-360 spin-photo). The control unit platform is based on Espruino. You can self-assemble the device from available components using detailed instructions, and you do not need deep knowledge in electronics. The turntable is also suitable for 3D scanning using photogrammetry methods.

### üîå First Connection Guide

The initial setup of the Android application involves the following steps:

1. **Create a Hotspot on Your Phone:**
   - Create a mobile hotspot with SSID `PhotoPizza` and password `9992030360`.
   - This will allow the control unit to connect to your phone directly.

2. **Power On the Control Unit:**
   - Turn on the PhotoPizza control unit.
   - During startup, the control unit will automatically connect to the hotspot you created.

3. **Connect Through the App:**
   - Open the PhotoPizza Remote app on your Android device.
   - The app will automatically detect and connect to the control unit.

4. **Optional: Configure for Home Network:**
   - You can continue using the hotspot method, or configure the system to use your home Wi-Fi network.
   - To use your home network, go to the app settings.
   - Enter your home Wi-Fi network parameters (SSID and password).
   - Save the settings.
   - Restart the control unit, and it will connect to your home network instead.
   - Your phone, when connected to the same home network, will be able to control the turntable without creating a hotspot.

## üåê Wi-Fi Control

### Connecting to Wi-Fi

The system can operate in two modes:

1. **Access Point (AP):**
   - The device creates an access point with SSID `PhotoPizza` and password `9992030360`.
   - To select this mode, set the `wirelessType` parameter to `ap`.

2. **Connecting to an Existing Network (Client):**
   - To connect to an existing network, set the `wirelessType` parameter to `conn`.
   - Set the network SSID in the `wifiSsid` parameter and the password in the `wifiPassword` parameter.

### Web Server

Wi-Fi control is an additional way to control the system. Through the web interface, you can manage the system state, change settings, and get current data.

1. The system launches a WebSocket server on the port specified in the configuration (`wsPort`).
2. Through the web interface, you can manage the system state, change settings, and get current data.

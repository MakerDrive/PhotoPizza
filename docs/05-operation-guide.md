# üì∏ Operation Guide

## üì∑ Shooting Process

1. **Object Placement:**
   - Place the item you want to photograph on the turntable.

2. **Setting Parameters:**
   - Use the IR remote or Android app to set the necessary shooting parameters:
     - Number of frames (`frame`).
     - Delay (`delay`) - delay time in milliseconds (e.g., `1000` milliseconds = 1 second).
     - Pause (`pause`) - pause time in milliseconds (e.g., `500` milliseconds = 0.5 seconds).
     - Speed (`speed`) - rotation speed in steps per second.
     - Rotation angle (`degreesX`) - rotation angle in degrees.

3. **Start Shooting:**
   - Press the `OK` button on the IR remote or the corresponding button in the app to confirm the settings.
   - To start the shooting process, press the `OK` button again. The turntable will start rotating and taking pictures automatically according to the set parameters.

4. **Stop Shooting:**
   - To stop the shooting process, press the `OK` button again.

5. **Infinite Shooting:**
   - To enable the infinite shooting mode, use the `"infinity"` command.

6. **Video Shooting:**
   - For video shooting, set the parameters for continuous rotation and turn on the camera in video mode. The turntable will rotate smoothly, providing even shooting from all sides.

7. **Saving Settings:**
   - After shooting, if you want to save the current settings for future shoots, press the `SAVE` button on the IR remote or use the save function in the app.

## üîÑ Calibration Process

### Why Calibration is Needed

Turntable calibration is necessary for accurately determining the rotation angle and ensuring correct object positioning. This allows the table to rotate precisely 360 degrees, returning to the starting point, which is important for creating high-quality 3D models, panoramic photos, and video shooting.

### Calibration Steps

1. **Preparation:**
   - Place the item opposite the drive roller on the turntable.

2. **Start Calibration:**
   - Press the `CALIBR` button on the IR remote or use the calibration function in the app to start the calibration process.

3. **Calibration Process:**
   - The turntable will start rotating. Stop it when the disk has rotated 360 degrees and is opposite the drive roller.
   - To stop the rotation, press the `OK` button.

4. **Saving Calibration:**
   - After completing the calibration process, press the `SAVE` button on the IR remote or use the save function in the app to save the settings.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Management

### Saving Configuration

To save the current settings, use the "Save Config" command in the management interface or press the `SAVE` button on the IR remote.

### Connecting to Wi-Fi

1. When connecting to Wi-Fi, the status is displayed on the screen.
2. If the connection is lost, the system will automatically attempt to reconnect.

## üìä Working with Screens

### Status Display

The screen displays current settings and system status, such as the number of remaining frames, speed, and IP address.

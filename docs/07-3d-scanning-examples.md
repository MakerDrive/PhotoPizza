# üè∫ 3D Scanning Examples

PhotoPizza turntables have been used in professional 3D scanning projects, including the digitization of valuable museum artifacts. Here are some notable examples:

## Japanese Netsuke Collection

The turntable was used to create detailed 3D scans of Japanese netsuke figurines from the State Hermitage Museum collection. During the process of improving 3D scanning automation, the ComplexScan prototype was developed, which significantly enhanced the quality and speed of digitizing these unique exhibits:

- **Demon in Front of a Mirror** - Highly detailed wooden netsuke with intricate relief
- **Coiled Carp** - Ivory and transparent horn netsuke with semi-transparent elements
- **Dog, Puppies, and an Old Hat** - Complex geometry with numerous small details
- **Wind God Fujin** - Wooden netsuke with open mouth and movable parts

## Sculptures by Sonia Kochina

The PhotoPizza D850 turntable was used to create high-quality 3D scans of sculptures by artist Sonia Kochina. This collection showcases the platform's capability to handle artistic works with complex geometries and fine details:

- **Red Witch** - Sculpture with intricate facial features and textured surfaces
- **The Frozen Face** - Detailed facial sculpture with subtle expressions
- **Two-faced** - Complex sculpture with dual perspectives
- **Magician and Rabbit** - Multi-element composition with varied textures

## Evolution to ComplexScan

The experience gained from these and other 3D scanning projects led to the development of the ComplexScan system - a more advanced platform specifically designed for professional photogrammetric 3D scanning. This system builds upon the PhotoPizza foundation while adding specialized features for museum-quality digitization of artifacts.

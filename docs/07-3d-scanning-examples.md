# üè∫ 3D Scanning Examples

PhotoPizza turntables have been used in professional 3D scanning projects, including the digitization of valuable museum artifacts. Here are some notable examples:

## Japanese Netsuke Collection

The turntable was used to create detailed 3D scans of Japanese netsuke figurines from the State Hermitage Museum collection. During the process of improving 3D scanning automation, the ComplexScan prototype was developed, which significantly enhanced the quality and speed of digitizing these unique exhibits:

- **Demon in Front of a Mirror** - Highly detailed wooden netsuke with intricate relief
- **Coiled Carp** - Ivory and transparent horn netsuke with semi-transparent elements
- **Dog, Puppies, and an Old Hat** - Complex geometry with numerous small details
- **Wind God Fujin** - Wooden netsuke with open mouth and movable parts

## Sculptures by Sonia Kochina

The PhotoPizza D850 turntable was used to create high-quality 3D scans of sculptures by artist Sonia Kochina. This collection showcases the platform's capability to handle artistic works with complex geometries and fine details:

- **Red Witch** - Sculpture with intricate facial features and textured surfaces
- **The Frozen Face** - Detailed facial sculpture with subtle expressions
- **Two-faced** - Complex sculpture with dual perspectives
- **Magician and Rabbit** - Multi-element composition with varied textures

## Digital Benin Collection

PhotoPizza D700 and D850 turntables were used in the digitization of historical artifacts from the Benin Kingdom for the Digital Benin project. These artifacts, housed in the Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (the Kunstkamera), showcase the platform's application in cultural heritage preservation:

- **Plaques with Images of Courtiers and Portuguese** - Bronze plaques with intricate relief details
- **Head of Ruler Oba in Ceremonial Headdress** - Complex royal artifact with fine ornamental elements
- **Plaque with Image of Leopard** - Detailed zoomorphic representation with cultural significance
- **Miniature Mask and Ceremonial Tusk** - Small-scale artifacts requiring precise rotation and lighting
- **Figurines of Priests and Courtiers** - Sculptures with varied surface textures and patinas

This project demonstrates how PhotoPizza turntables contribute to global cultural heritage digitization initiatives, making historically significant artifacts accessible to researchers and the public worldwide.

## Evolution to ComplexScan

The experience gained from these and other 3D scanning projects led to the development of the ComplexScan system - a more advanced platform specifically designed for professional photogrammetric 3D scanning. This system builds upon the PhotoPizza foundation while adding specialized features for museum-quality digitization of artifacts.
